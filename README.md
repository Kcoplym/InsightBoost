# InsightBoost
Free open source tool to speed up EDA and Mode selection, using Sweetviz and LazyPredict

The Basics:

There are two pages, one for EDA and model selection.

Both allow you to upload a csv and in EDA produce a SweetViz report and in the model selection page, allows you to select the target feature.

Changes to be made:

Model selection results are only viewable via CLI, integrate into PYQT for ease of use. (produce output?)

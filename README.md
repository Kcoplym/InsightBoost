# InsightBoost
Free open source tool to speed up EDA and Mode selection, using Sweetviz and LazyPredict

The Basics:

There are two pages, one for EDA and model selection.

Both allow you to upload a csv and in EDA produce a SweetViz report and in the model selection page, allows you to select the target feature.

Changes to be made:

Model selection results are only viewable via CLI, integrate into PYQT for ease of use. (produce output?)

Get docker file to work, not sure if possible but thought it would be cool to create this an image
